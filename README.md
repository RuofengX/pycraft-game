# Pycraft, the game

Pycraft is a multi-player sand-box game coding in python.
This repo contains its server program and client SDK.
Pycraft provides several API and a python SDK to connect to.

Pycraft official provides a public server, feel free to try!

## The game is still working in progress

## Some principles

1. Player(You) first. The connection of players builds the core experience of Pycraft.
2. Existences continuum. Whenever a player is logged in, the in-game entity will constantly exists. The whole data of simulated world will also be stored onto cloud.
3. Rolling update. Game will keep updating in a roll, just like the university itself.
